My thoughts on building this as a full scale application :-

To build this project as a full scale application on the web or native mobile, I would create a list view and add/append the results fetched from the API into a datasource array so they are cached.
This data source array would serve as the data source for the list view. I would auto load more data as the user scrolls to the end of the list with some offset so the
next page loads soon enough as the user is about to reach the end of that page. I would add a spinner to the end of the list view so when the data is loading, the spinner shows that
the fetch is underway and gets hidden when that page loading is complete.

I would also start with test driven development, i.e. write tests first and then build the functionality. The tests would include testing the following -
1) Testing API params are formed correctly.
2) Testing that API is successful.
3) Testing UI is formed correctly with proper layout and constraints.
4) Any other test cases.
